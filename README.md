# UI-Designs
This repository contains UI designs for two projects: an organic agricultural product-selling website and a mobile app for monitoring anxiety levels in university students. The website focuses on creating a user-friendly shopping experience, while the app offers a calming interface for anxiety management, enhancing usability and user engagement.
